Dear Team,


All the files uploaded here are programmed by me. And I have written explanation at class level and method level.

This project is folder management system.
If given a folder for example : /root/home/user/sample.txt
If this folder structure exists, then traverses through this structure and creates a file in this folder.
If this file already exists then, it returns the file to the user with complete relative file path.
